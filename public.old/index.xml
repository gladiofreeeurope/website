      <description>Letov: It’s punk rock, Russian punk rock. I wouldn’t even focus on the style, there are many different styles. We have a few projects, Kommunizm, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, and my own personal project. On the whole, it’s garage rock, garage punk.
Interviewer: Punk rock means you’re against something, right? That’s how it was in the West 10 years ago. Can you compare Western music to your own?
L: I think that Russian rock has always differed from your rock.</description>

      <description>A fool wanders through the forest Looking for a fool even greater than him
Death walks down the street, carrying blini1
on a plate Whoever takes one will have his fate She&amp;rsquo;ll touch him on the shoulder and kiss him passionately And pennies will fly out of his ass
A fool wanders through the forest Looking for a fool even greater than him
The gears are turning in my head My head is drenched in an armor-piercing rain The mercury boiled and my fist went for a blow But if you put a cross on your chest, you must Put coins on the eyes2</description>

      <description>The key to our borders has been broken in two And Our Father1 Lenin has withered away He&amp;rsquo;s decomposed into mold and linden honey. And the Perestroika is still going according to plan. And the mud has turned into black ice, and everything is going according to plan.
And my destiny wants some rest. I promised it not to join the game of war But on my army cap, there is a hammer and a sickle and a star How touching &amp;ndash; a hammer, a sickle and a star The dashing lantern of anticipation is dangling back and forth And everything is going according to plan</description>

      <description>A rusty bunker - that’s my freedom The sweet pastry has long ago dried up With the boots of my people The foremen hamper the shit
Hidden around the corner Someone killed with a garbage can The one who willingly descended into the basement Doomed to failure from the start
I killed the government within me
Mute in a world of invective Able to see in a world of empty eye sockets Balancing on the edge Between rows of thick eyebrows1</description>

      <description>For an overabundance of wit, there&amp;rsquo;s only beggars&amp;rsquo; bowls and prison
For a boistrous brain, there are only ditches and dikes For a beautiful brain, there are only scabs and lice For universal love there are only bloodied faces
A bedsheet blows in the wind, walking through morning dew From fruitless ideas to ethereal guests From closed doors to buried animals From covered tables to heads busted open
A black satellite flies parallel to the road He will console and save, he will deliver peace Under a coarse wing, night around a round table A red-white poster, start up the scooter</description>
