[Hernán](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9645942/) is a Mexican series that revolves around the story of Hernán Cortés, the Spanish Conquistador who led an expedition that caused the fall of the Aztec Empire and brought large portions of what is now mainland Mexico under the rule of the King of Castile in the early 16th century.

To discuss this story, and this series, we're joined by Paul Guinan, the writer working on [Aztec Empire](https://www.bigredhair.com/books/aztec-empire/about/), a graphic novel recounting the dramatic fall of the mightiest empire in the Americas, only three years after the arrival of strangers from another world.
