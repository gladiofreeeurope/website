Our good friend Jern joins us from Ohio for a discussion about the interwar reanimation of America's most notorious terrorist organization: the Ku Klux Klan. Jern tells the story of the working-class Ohio immigrants who formed their own secret society known as the Knights of the Flaming Circle to oppose white supremacy and kick the Klan out of the Buckeye state.
