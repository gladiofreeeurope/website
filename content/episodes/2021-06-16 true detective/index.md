[True Detective](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/) season 2 is pretty good. We don't really talk about it. Instead we delve into the real life stories that inspired the show, and some events that remind us of what we watched.

Topics covered in this episode: Vernon, California, Political corruption, Voter suppression, Child abuse, Suspicious deaths, Satanic panic, Prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein, “Suicide,” and Bryan Singer.
