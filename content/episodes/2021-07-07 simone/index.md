In 2002, [S1m0ne](https://letterboxd.com/film/s1m0ne/) posed the question of what would happen if were to replace actors with  computers. What 20 years ago seemed like a fantasy in the realm of  science fiction has increasingly begun to rear its head in our world,  and we as a society are still grappling with the consequences and  implications of our increasingly virtual reality.

Computer-generated actors, models, influencers, and pop stars, weâ€™ve got them all on this week's episode.Hosted by [Liam](https://twitter.com/LegoRacers2), [Abram](https://twitter.com/abnormcore), and [Pam](https://twitter.com/buzzfeedjenny).
