We're back in Morocco! We pick up with the reign of Mawlay Muhammad III, often called the "architect of modern Morocco." In addition to building up several new cities, Muhammad reformed the state through a sweeping decentralization of power. Although effective at dealing with the challenges of his own time, Muhammad's reforms would have negative ramifications down the line. We catch up with his rowdy half-Irish son Yazid and his never-ending series of rebellions, as well as his other son Suleiman, whose tenure would be marked by near constant turmoil. We also take a deep dive into the foundations of Moroccan society, and the many internal dynamics which defined the country. From taxation to religion to agriculture and the divisions between self-identified Arabs and Imazighen (Berber) peoples, we go beyond personalized explanations for the problems which would plague Morocco both internally and in its relations with the outside world. We cap the episode off with a riveting conclusion to our Barbary Pirate saga, and the ways that the United States would for the first time wage war halfway across the world. So hop on our brig as we sail to the distant shores of North Africa and enjoy the show!
