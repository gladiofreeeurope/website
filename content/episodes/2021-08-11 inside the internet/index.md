The Internet is what gives us power. It's an energy field created by all artificial things. It surrounds us. It penetrates us. It binds humanity together.

We talk about it by way of the National Geographic TV documentary [Inside the Internet: 50 Years of Life Online](https://letterboxd.com/film/inside-the-internet-50-years-of-life-online/), which you can [watch here](https://streamtape.com/v/4BkD0KRwyaCKQmG).

Hosted by [Liam](https://twitter.com/LegoRacers2), [Abram](https://twitter.com/abnormcore), and [Pam](https://twitter.com/buzzfeedjenny).
