[Nosferatu](https://letterboxd.com/film/nosferatu/) is the 1922 expressionist horror silent film whose creation is dramatized in the movie [Shadow of the Vampire](https://letterboxd.com/film/shadow-of-the-vampire/). We watched both these films and discuss both their stories, and the stories of how the vampire came to be in the popular imagination.
