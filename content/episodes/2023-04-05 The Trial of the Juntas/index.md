With Argentina, 1985 having been in the running for Best Foreign Language Film, we are joined by our good friend ⁠Kevin⁠ as we delve into the history of the Argentinian Junta and its genocidal campaign of disappearances, extrajudicial murder, torture, and the kidnapping of children. The latter crime is the subject of The Official Story, another Argentinian movie which actually was made in 1985 and approaches the crimes of the period from a more personal angle. 

Using these two films as a jumping off point, we tell the harrowing story of this dictatorship and the long struggle to bring the participants to justice. Who were the junteros and how did they seize power? What was the P2 connection? How were they ousted and why was the legal battle against them such an uphill battle? Finally, what do these movies get right (and wrong) about the events depicted, and what do they have to say about the state of Argentinian society at the times of their making? All this and more on this episode of Gladio Free Europe.
