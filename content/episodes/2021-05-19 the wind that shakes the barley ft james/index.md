[The Wind That Shakes the Barley](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wind-that-shakes-the-barley/) tells the story of Damien O’Donovan (Cillian Murphy), an Irish doctor turned guerrilla fighter after witnessing the brutality of British occupying forces in his home of County Cork. He joins his brother, Teddy O’Donovan (Pádraic Delaney), in fighting for the Irish Republican Army for Irish independence from the United Kingdom.

We’re joined by our friend James to discuss this movie, the brutality Ireland endured during occupation, the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Civil War, and what effects from this period of history linger to this day.

*Correction*: At 15:30 Liam says that Soviet Russia was the first country to recognize Ireland. Although the Soviets took an early interest in the Irish War of Independence, diplomatic recognition did not happen at this time because Eamon De Valera feared that following through would antagonize the United States, and the Soviets had begun to negotiate the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement. The Republic of Ireland would not recognize the Soviet Union until 1973!
