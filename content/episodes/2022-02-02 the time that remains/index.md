Our friend Fathi joins us to discuss [The Time That Remains](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-time-that-remains/), a 2009 film that examines the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 through to the present day. A semi-biographic film, in four chapters, about a family spanning from 1948 until recent times attempts to portray the daily life of those Palestinians who remained in their land and were labelled “Israeli-Arabs,” living as a minority in their own homeland.
