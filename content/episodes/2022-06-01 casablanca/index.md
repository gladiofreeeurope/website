Play it again, Russian Sam. The gang takes a deep dive into the circumstances that produced the most celebrated picture in Hollywood history: [Casablanca](https://letterboxd.com/film/casablanca/). We explore how a distant Moroccan port became a cosmopolitan haven for Europe's refugees, delve into the notorious Vichy French government that ran wartime North Africa, and explain how the most beloved American film almost didn't happen in this week's episode.
