We take a look back at a time when the ghosts of men were possessing spirit mediums all over the country to tell tales of life on the other side. From Mark Twain writing a new novel, to Thomas Paine endorsing spiritualism, to Jesus writing an autobiography, it was a time when it felt like everyone was coming back from the dead and getting a book deal. We talk about it, as well as how Spiritualism came to be, what it meant, and some encounters famous figures from the era had with Spiritualists.
