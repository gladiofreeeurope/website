Everyone’s favorite Ukrainian-Canadian diaspora chronicler Jim takes us to the Carpathians for an episode on peasants, poultices, and Parajanov. We discuss the director's 1964 film [Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors](https://letterboxd.com/film/shadows-of-forgotten-ancestors/) and what this classic of Soviet surrealism can tell us about the past.

Check out Jim’s podcast, [The Past with Jim](https://thepastwithjim.podbean.com/).
