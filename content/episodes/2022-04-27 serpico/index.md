We meet with lifelong New Yorker Derek Putin to discuss [Serpico](https://letterboxd.com/film/serpico/), a story of sleaze and scandal in the 70s NYPD. We talk about the iconic 1973 movie starring Al Pacino and the man who inspired it, a rare good cop who's crusade against corruption earned him a bullet in the face.

This episode explores other scandals that plagued the NYPD across the late 20th century and how they've shaped the force today, ending with Frank Serpico's own words on policing and what, if anything, can be done to fix it.
