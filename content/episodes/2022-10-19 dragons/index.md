From Godzilla to Game of Thrones, dragons dominate today's pop culture landscape and play a monstrous role in the modern imagination. But how did this obsession with fire-breathing reptiles begin? For this week's episode, Liam and Russian Sam follow the cultural history of dragons across Europe and Asia. We explore why so many cultures imagined their own colossal serpents, diving into paleontology, mythology, and evolutionary psychology to figure out why  these scaly creatures delighted the minds and haunted the dreams of our ancestors for thousands of years.
