[To Live](https://letterboxd.com/film/to-live/) tells the story of a degenerate gambler and his shadow puppets. But it also tells the story of one family living through the Chinese Civil War, the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution.

This film and its reception would also mirror a process which has been ongoing since the beginning of Xi Jinping's tenure: the battle against so-called "historical nihilism". We look to the CPC, and Xi himself, to learn what historical nihilism is and how we can fight against it.
