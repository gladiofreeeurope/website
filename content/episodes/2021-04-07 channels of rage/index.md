We discuss the 2003 Israeli documentary [Channels of Rage](https://letterboxd.com/film/channels-of-rage/) that follows around a couple of rappers in Tel Aviv and discuss the political situation in which it was filmed in. Apologies about Liam's audio.

Hosted by [Liam](https://twitter.com/LegoRacers2), [Russian Sam](https://twitter.com/OverproducedPMC), and [Abram](https://twitter.com/abnormcore).

*Correction: at 8:20 Sam says Israel normalized relations with Kuwait. He meant to say Bahrain.*
