This week, we talk about centaurs, demons, and self-filling pots of food. That's right, we're talking about saints and their hagiographies! This unusual genre stands at the crossroads between the Late Antique and Medieval worlds, and despite their often strange contents, they have a lot to tell us about the world in which they were written. Finally, we  look at a firmly modern saint, a martyr who perished in the 1940s, and  consider the ways in which the passage of time has likely sanitized many  of the saints, many of whom were probably far from saintly by contemporary standards.
