After a couple weeks of adventuring across Japan and the Caucasus, the hosts of Gladio Free Europe are back in the States. Liam shares his experiences seeing the traces of the violent Sengoku period all across Japan's main island Honshu, and explains how this trip finally brought him to his "white guy into Buddhism" phase. Thousands of miles away, Russian Sam visited the ancient nations of Armenia and Georgia and got a front-seat view of how influences from east and west continue to vie over these countries today.

We'll be back very soon with full episodes on the history of Japan, Armenia, and Georgia, beginning this month we dive into the chaotic finale of Japan's Warring States Period, when a period of intense international ambition gave way to the famous centuries of isolation.
