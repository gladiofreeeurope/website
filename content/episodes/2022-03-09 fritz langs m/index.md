Fritz Lang’s first talking picture, [M](https://letterboxd.com/film/m/) tells the story of a town shaken by a string of serial murders by a killer who targets young girls. This Weimar era film stood out as one of the most well crafted movies to date upon release. We talk about it, the director, and the German movie industry it was made in.
