Gladio Free Europe received a frosty transmission this week from the icy waters of the Bering Sea. Writer, prophet, and friend of the pod Jon called in to talk about life in Alaska. We run through the past 300 years of the 49th state, beginning with initial bloody encounters between indigenous Yupik and Inuit peoples and the Russian Empire and the ensuing colonial contest with Britain, the United States, and even Spain. By the end of this episode, you'll know exactly what makes Alaska so different from the Lower 48, the reason American merchants were so set on acquiring the territory, and why famous sled-dog Balto is a damned fraud.
