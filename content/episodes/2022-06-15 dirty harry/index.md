As the Zodiac Killer was tormenting San Francisco, and captivating the rest of the country, came [Dirty Harry](https://letterboxd.com/film/dirty-harry/), a movie about a hard nosed cop who takes down a serial killer called Scorpio. We talk about it, why people may have convinced themselves there were more similarities than there were, and the general topic of escalating violence within society and cinema.
