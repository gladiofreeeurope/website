Grab your throwing-axe because we're going deep into barbarian territory for this episode on the birth of the medieval world. Continuing from last month's discussion on the Late Roman Empire, this week we've recruited archaeogenetic shield maiden Natasha to help us understand the origins and impact of a culture who conquered half of Europe and might just be the most successful barbarians of them all.
