And we're back! Liam and Russian Sam return to the early middle ages to explore the unique and unbelievably fascinating history of Medieval Sicily. A true crossroads of civilization, this sun-soaked island has been influenced by cultures from every corner of the Mediterranean and beyond and is an amazing microcosm for the entire history of Europe and the Middle East as well. The first of a two-part series, this episode recounts many incredible stories of Sicily's Islamic period. Get ready to hear about how Sicily drew Arab adventurers into the cutthroat politics of Italy's city-states, why you should never accept a dinner invitation from Emir Ibrahim, and how these Islamic newcomers gave us the one Sicilian word that everybody knows
