We continue our journey into medieval Sicily by following the rag-tag band of Normans who carved out a tiny foothold on the Italian peninsula. In less than 50 years, these French-speaking adventurers and grandchildren of the Vikings would unite Southern Italy and established themselves as the overlords on the advanced and prosperous island of Sicily. Weâ€™ll explore how these adventurers like Robert Guiscard and the warrior-queen Sikelgaita were able to defeat popes, emirs, and even Byzantine Emperors and discuss how these new Norman rulers would join, and not destroy, the existing Arab civilization of Sicily.
