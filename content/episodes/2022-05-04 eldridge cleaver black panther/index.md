Our interest in 1960s radicalism has lead us back to North Korea, this time by way of the Black Panther Party. Using Eldridge Cleaver's memoir [Soul on Fire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261897.Soul_on_Fire) as our guide, we discuss the links between Black radicalism and Cuba, China, and North Korea.

The documentary about Eldridge Cleaver in Algeria is [available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g761Cfi8bwA).
