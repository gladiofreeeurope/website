The key to our borders has been broken in two \
And Our Father[^1] Lenin has withered away \
He's decomposed into mold and linden honey. \
And the Perestroika is still going according to plan. \
And the mud has turned into black ice, and everything is going according to plan.
 
And my destiny wants some rest. \
I promised it not to join the game of war \
But on my army cap, there is a hammer and a sickle and a star \
How touching -- a hammer, a sickle and a star \
The dashing lantern of anticipation is dangling back and forth \
And everything is going according to plan

And they fed my wife to the hordes \
With the fist of the world they trampled on her chest \
With worldwide liberty they tore apart her flesh \
So bury her in Christ - and everything shall go according to plan
 
Only our grandfather Lenin was a good leader \
All the other ones are such shit \
All the others are enemies and total morons \
Over bloody Russia falls a torrent of snow \
Over the homeland, the land of our fathers, an insane snow was falling.

I bought a copy of "Korea"[^2] -- they have it good too. \
They have Comrade Kim Il-Sung, it’s the same over there. \
I‘m sure that they have the same thing and everything is going according to plan.
 
When we get communism it'll all be fucking great \
It will come soon, we just gotta wait \
Everything will be free there, it’ll be like we’re high \
We probably won’t even have to die. \
I woke up in the middle of the night and understood that everything is going according to the plan.
