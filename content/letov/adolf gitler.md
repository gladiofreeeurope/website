Corporal Schiklgruber[^1] wasn't in prison for naught \
Corporal Schiklgruber wasn't in prison for naught \
That's where he wrote Mein Kampf \
That's where he wrote Mein Kampf \
A textbook for sadists and exceptional bastards \
A textbook for the strong, a textbook for Achilles \
That's where he wrote Mein Kampf

Mein Kampf, Mein Kampf \
Read Mein Kampf \
Read Mein Kampf \
Mein Kampf, Mein Kampf \
Read Mein Kampf

Corporal Schiklgruber was a maniac and masochist \
Corporal Schiklgruber was a maniac and masochist \
How do you transform a person into a fascist? \
How do you transform a person into a fascist? \
An ape has a long way to go to become a man \
But becoming an ape is very easy for a man

Mein Kampf, Mein Kampf \
Read Mein Kampf \
Read Mein Kampf \
Mein Kampf, Mein Kampf \
Read Mein Kampf

Mein Kampf! \
Read Mein Kampf!
