A fool wanders through the forest
Looking for a fool even greater than him

Death walks down the street, carrying blini

[^1]: Blini are a bit like pancakes

 on a plate
Whoever takes one will have his fate
She'll touch him on the shoulder and kiss him passionately
And pennies will fly out of his ass

A fool wanders through the forest
Looking for a fool even greater than him

The gears are turning in my head
My head is drenched in an armor-piercing rain
The mercury boiled and my fist went for a blow
But if you put a cross on your chest, you must
Put coins on the eyes

[^2]: Reference to the custom of leaving coins on or inside the bodies of the deceased so that they may pay to cross over into the next world

A fool wanders through the forest
Looking for a fool even greater than him

My deceased mom visited me yesterday
She threatened me with her fist and called me a fool
A mosquito of the dawn descended into my flame
He choked on the blood from my temple

A fool wanders through the world
Looking for a fool even greater than him

I bought some balloons today
I will use them to fly over this wondrous land
I will swallow pollen and dive into the ground
And answer any questions with "I'm always alive!"

A fool wanders through the sky
Looking for a fool even greater than him

The sun shone both day and night
There are no atheists in trenches under fire
The blind one will come running, the worthless one will win
You'd never dream that up

A fool wanders through the world
Looking for a fool even greater than him

A fool wanders through the world
Looking for a fool even greater than him
