Sid Vicious died before your eyes   
John Lennon died before your eyes   
Jim Morrison died before your eyes  
But you’ve stayed as you were...    


There are only two paths for honest fellows	\
Grab an automatic and kill everyone	\
Or kill yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself \
If you earnestly perceive this world...  


The ends justify the means, let’s go  \
Kill, rape, slander, betray   \
For the sake of the light, light, light, light  \
The bright building of the Juche idea   


Everything left undone by <cite>Mamai[^1]</cite> \
Was done in October, brought to a close \
October had completed the arc  \
And there’s nothing left for us to do here...    


My friend hanged himself before our eyes \
He did harakiri right on our porch  \
He was drained of hope and all that he could \
But you’ve all stayed as you were! 

[^1]: Mamai was one of the heads of the Golden Horde
