Here's everything that has been \
It didn't exist nor does it now \
All of the layers are soaked \
All of the words have burned

Everything's as it should be[^1]

[^1]: Idiomatic expression. The literal translation would be "everything is like what others have"

In worn out boots \
Years and cigarette buds \
In worn out pockets \
Passports and fingers

Everything's as it should be

Sprightly wheels \
Durable buildings \
New decrees \
Brotherly graves

Everything's as it should be

Here's everything that has been \
It didn't exist nor does it now \
Correct and clear \
Awesome and forever

Everything's as it should be
