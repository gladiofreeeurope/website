Lenin is Hitler, Lenin is Stalin
Lenin is Kim Il Sung, Lenin is Mao
Lenin is Buddha, Christ, and Cain and Abel
Lenin is the Yin and the Yang, Lenin is the Dao

Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live

[^1]: A reference to a poem by Mayakovsky

Lenin will, will, will
Lenin, Lenin he will live!

Lenin is the jokes with which they hound us
Lenin is the pastries with which they entice us
Lenin is the hands with which they pound us

[^2]: A bit of a double entendre. The word лепить has a number of meanings, among them to mold, to paste, or to pound.

Lenin is the projectors with which they blind us

Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live
Lenin will, will, will
Lenin, Lenin he will live!

Lenin is the hammer with which they beat us in
Lenin is everything used to control us
Lenin is the tanks with which they crush us
Lenin is the truths with which they poison us

Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live
Lenin will, will, will
Lenin, Lenin he will live!

Lenin is the bullet which cures us
Lenin is the fright which wounds us
Lenin is the ass which we stink in
Lenin is the blood which we slurp down

Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live
Lenin will, will, will
Lenin, Lenin he will live!

Lenin is Hitler, Lenin is Stalin
Lenin is Kim Il Sung, Lenin is Mao
He is forever young, forever with us
He is always, always alive!

Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live
Lenin will, will, will
Lenin, Lenin he will live!
