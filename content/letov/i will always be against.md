title: Lyrics for I Will Always Be Against (1988)

{{< youtube llm-Xz_Wzl8 >}}

Falling into ditches, smelling the stench of corpses \
Solving the problems of global communism \
In circle after circle of darkness, communists march forward! \
The source of objections packaged by the Sovdep[^1]!

I will always be against this!

He who has not yet broken down, his time will come \
Fill the rebelâ€™s chest with bullets \
Exhaustively delving into pro-Soviet bullshit \
In a healthy state there shall be a healthy peace

I will always be against this!

The leaders have converged on a uniform price[^2] \
The honorable descendents of harmonious fathers \
The eyes pierce through circle after circle of darkness \
Fullheartedly expressing a forced ecstasy

I will always be against this!

[^1]: Sovdep was a derogatory term for the Soviet system
[^2]: Word used is _vozhd_. Soviet leaders are meant in this case.
