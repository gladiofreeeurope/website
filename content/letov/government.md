A rusty bunker - that’s my freedom \
The sweet pastry has long ago dried up \
With the boots of my people \
The foremen hamper the shit

Hidden around the corner \
Someone killed with a garbage can \
The one who willingly descended into the basement \
Doomed to failure from the start 

I killed the government within me 

Mute in a world of invective \
Able to see in a world of empty eye sockets \
Balancing on the edge \
Between rows of thick eyebrows[^1] 

The forgotten are around the corner \
Dulled by the garbage can \
The exhausted into the basement \
Doomed to failure from the start

We’ve killed the government within us

A rusty bunker - that’s your freedom \
A door boarded up with a cross \
A whole ditch full of the enemies of the people \
I will cover it with dry leaves 

Hidden around the corner \
Someone killed with a garbage can \
The one who willingly descended into the basement \
Doomed to failure from the start

KILL THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN YOU!

Kill!
