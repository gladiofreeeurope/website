The plastic world has won

The model turned out to be stronger

The last ship has gone cold

The last flashlight is tired

And clumps of memory are stuck in my throat



Oh - my defense

A glimmer of light in an unseeing world

Oh - my defense

A mournful little ball of an absurd world

A mournful little ball of a cheap world



The plastic world has won

The cardboard alarm rejoices

Who needs a slice of the July sky?



Oh - my defense

A glimmer of light in a glass eye

Oh - my defense

A mournful little ball of glass world

A mournful little ball of an absurd world



The plastic world has won

The model turned out to be stronger

The last ship has gone cold

The last flashlight is tired

And clumps of memory are stuck in my throat



Oh - my defense

A mournful little ball of an unseeing world

Oh - my defense

A glimmer of light of a glass world



Oh - my defense
