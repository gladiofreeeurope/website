I see my motherland rising up from its knees \
I see my motherland rising from the ashes \
I hear my great motherland singing \
My motherland is once more rising up from its knees
 
My epic nation is unbending its back \
Our wrathful power is moving apart the walls \
The sun calls us to follow it on campaign \
Against deadly cold, against pitch-black night
 
I see my motherland rising up from its knees \
I see my motherland rising up with fury and pride \
I hear my great motherland singing \
My motherland is once more rising up from its knees
 
My mighty nation throws off its shackles \
The dawn blazes bright and hot in our hearts \
Our breath thaws and melts the ice \
The earth blooms under our feet
 
I see my motherland rising up from its knees \
I see my motherland rising from the ashes \
I hear my Soviet motherland singing \
My motherland is once more rising up from its knees
 
My epic nation is unbending its back \
Our wrathful power is moving apart the walls \
The sun calls us to follow it on campaign \
Against deadly cold, against pitch-black night
 
I see my motherland rising up from its knees \
I see my motherland rising from the ashes \
My motherland fiercely blazes inside me \
I hear my Soviet motherland singing
 
Motherland \
Motherland \
Motherland
