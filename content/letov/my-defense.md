The plastic world has won \
The model turned out to be stronger \
The last ship has gone cold \
The last flashlight is tired \
And clumps of memory are stuck in my throat


Oh - my defense \
A glimmer of light in an unseeing world \
Oh - my defense \
A mournful little ball of an absurd world \
A mournful little ball of a cheap world


The plastic world has won \
The cardboard alarm rejoices \
Who needs a slice of the July sky?

Oh - my defense \
A glimmer of light in a glass eye \
Oh - my defense \
A mournful little ball of glass world \
A mournful little ball of an absurd world


The plastic world has won \
The model turned out to be stronger \
The last ship has gone cold \
The last flashlight is tired \
And clumps of memory are stuck in my throat


Oh - my defense \
A mournful little ball of an unseeing world \
Oh - my defense \
A glimmer of light of a glass world

Oh - my defense
